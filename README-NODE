# Node Mode with CKPOOL-LHR

## Use Case

Node mode combines passthrough functionality with local bitcoind and block
submission capability. It behaves like passthrough but requires a locally
running bitcoind and can submit blocks itself in addition to forwarding shares
to the upstream pool. This provides redundant block submission paths and allows
for distributed pool architecture.

**Ideal for:**
- Distributed pool architecture with local block submission
- Redundant block submission paths
- Regional pool nodes with local bitcoind
- High-availability pool deployments

## How Node Mode Works

In node mode, ckpool-lhr combines passthrough functionality (streaming individual
miner data to upstream pool) with local bitcoind connectivity. The node can
submit blocks to its local bitcoind in addition to forwarding shares to the
upstream pool. This provides redundancy - if the upstream pool has issues, the
node can still submit blocks locally.

**Workflow**: Downstream miners connect → Subscribe → Authorize → Receive work →
Submit shares → Node streams miner data to upstream pool AND can submit blocks
to local bitcoind → Upstream pool validates and responds → Node forwards responses
to downstream miners.

**Important**: 
- Requires local bitcoind connection (btcd configuration required)
- Monitors hashrate and requires additional resources
- Upstream pools must specify dedicated IPs/ports for node communication using
  the `nodeserver` directive
- Preserves individual miner identity on upstream pool

For complete configuration reference, see the main README.

## Required Options

### Command Line

**`-N` or `--node`**: **REQUIRED** to start ckpool-lhr in node mode.

Example:
```bash
src/ckpool -N
```

### Configuration File

**"btcd"** : Bitcoind connection configuration. **REQUIRED**
- Type: Array of objects
- Each entry: url (string, required), auth (string, required), pass (string, required),
  cookie (string, optional), notify (boolean, optional)
- Default: localhost:8332 with user "user" and password "pass" if not specified
- Note: Cookie-based authentication can be used as an alternative to auth/pass by
  specifying the cookie file path instead of auth/pass.
- Example:
```json
"btcd" : [
    {
        "url" : "127.0.0.1:8332",
        "auth" : "username",
        "pass" : "password",
        "notify" : true
    }
]
```

**"proxy"** : Upstream pool connection configuration. **REQUIRED**
- Type: Array of objects
- Each entry: url (string, required), auth (string, required), pass (string, required)
- Multiple entries can be specified for redundancy/load balancing
- Example:
```json
"proxy" : [
    {
        "url" : "upstream.pool.com:3333",
        "auth" : "username",
        "pass" : "password"
    }
]
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure bitcoind

Edit `bitcoin.conf` to enable RPC:
```
server=1
rpcuser=username
rpcpassword=password
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
```

Restart bitcoind with ZMQ notifications (recommended):
```
-zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
```

Or use the notifier if ZMQ is unavailable:
```
-blocknotify=$CKPOOLSOURCE/src/notifier
```
(Replace `$CKPOOLSOURCE` with your CKPOOL-LHR source path)

### 2. Create Configuration File

Copy the example configuration file and customize it:
```bash
cp cknode.conf.example cknode.conf
```

Edit `cknode.conf` with the required `btcd` and `proxy` settings (see Required Options above).

### 3. Start ckpool-lhr in Node Mode

```bash
src/ckpool -N
```

### 4. Configure Your Miners

Point your mining hardware to the node:
- **URL**: `192.168.1.100:3334` (your node IP address, default port 3334)
- **Username**: Your upstream pool username (preserved to upstream)
- **Password**: Your upstream pool password (preserved to upstream)

## Optional Configuration Options

All configuration options relevant to node mode are listed below. Options not
listed (btcaddress, redirecturl, trusted) are not used in node mode.

**"upstream"** : Upstream pool URL for trusted remote mode. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: String
- Values: "hostname:port" format
- Default: None
- Note: Used when operating as a trusted remote node that connects to an upstream pool.
  The upstream pool should specify this node in its "trusted" configuration.
- Example: `"upstream" : "main.pool.com:3336"`

**"serverurl"** : Server bindings for miner connections. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Array of strings
- Values: "IP:port" or "hostname:port"
- Default: All interfaces on port 3334
- Note: Ports below 1024 usually require privileged access
- Example: `"serverurl" : ["192.168.1.100:3334", "127.0.0.1:3334"]`

**"nodeserver"** : Additional bindings for mining node communications. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Array of strings
- Values: "IP:port" or "hostname:port"
- Default: None
- Note: Isolate these addresses for security. Used for upstream pool connections.
- Example: `"nodeserver" : ["10.0.0.1:3335"]`

**"blockpoll"** : Frequency to poll bitcoind for new blocks. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Integer
- Values: Milliseconds
- Default: 100
- Note: Only used if "notify" is not set on btcd entry.

**"zmqblock"** : ZMQ interface for block notifications. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: String
- Values: ZMQ URL format
- Default: "tcp://127.0.0.1:28332"
- Note: Requires bitcoind -zmqpubhashblock option.

**"logdir"** : Directory for logs. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: String
- Default: "logs"

**"maxclients"** : Maximum concurrent client connections. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Integer
- Default: 0 (no limit)

**"useragent"** : Allowed user agent strings (whitelist). **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Array of strings
- Default: None (all allowed)
- Note: Prefix matching. Empty user agents rejected if whitelist configured.
