# Userproxy Mode with CKPOOL-LHR

## Use Case

Userproxy mode is a proxy mode that preserves individual miner credentials to
the upstream pool. It accepts username/password from each stratum connection and
opens additional connections with those credentials to the upstream pool, allowing
each miner to maintain their separate identity on the upstream pool.

**Ideal for:**
- Transparent proxy preserving miner authentication
- Multi-pool aggregation with individual tracking
- Credential passthrough scenarios
- Maintaining individual miner statistics on upstream pool

## How Userproxy Mode Works

In userproxy mode, ckpool-lhr accepts connections from downstream miners and
extracts their username/password credentials from the stratum authorization
message. For each unique set of credentials, the userproxy opens a separate
connection to the upstream pool using those credentials. Each downstream miner
maintains their individual identity on the upstream pool, allowing for separate
tracking and statistics.

**Workflow**: Downstream miners connect → Subscribe → Authorize with
username/password → Userproxy extracts credentials → Opens connection to
upstream pool with those credentials → Forwards work to downstream miner →
Downstream miner submits shares → Userproxy forwards shares to upstream pool
on appropriate connection → Upstream pool validates and responds → Userproxy
forwards responses to downstream miner.

**Important**: 
- Each miner maintains separate identity on upstream pool
- Requires upstream pool to support multiple connections with different credentials
- Requires additional resources due to multiple upstream connections per unique credential set

## Required Options

### Command Line

**`-u` or `--userproxy`**: **REQUIRED** to start ckpool-lhr in userproxy mode.

Example:
```bash
src/ckpool -u
```

### Configuration File

**"proxy"** : Upstream pool connection configuration. **REQUIRED**
- Type: Array of objects
- Each entry: url (string, required), auth (string, required), pass (string, required)
- Multiple entries can be specified for redundancy/load balancing
- Note: The auth/pass in proxy config may be used as fallback, but individual
  miner credentials take precedence
- Example:
```json
"proxy" : [
    {
        "url" : "upstream.pool.com:3333",
        "auth" : "username",
        "pass" : "password"
    },
    {
        "url" : "backup.pool.com:3333",
        "auth" : "username",
        "pass" : "password"
    }
]
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Configuration File

Copy the example configuration file and customize it:
```bash
cp ckproxy.conf.example ckproxy.conf
```

Edit `ckproxy.conf` with the required `proxy` setting (see Required Options above).

### 2. Start ckpool-lhr in Userproxy Mode

```bash
src/ckpool -u
```

### 3. Configure Your Miners

Point your mining hardware to the userproxy:
- **URL**: `192.168.1.100:3334` (your userproxy IP address, default port 3334)
- **Username**: Your upstream pool username (preserved to upstream)
- **Password**: Your upstream pool password (preserved to upstream)

**Note**: Each miner should use their own upstream pool credentials. The
userproxy will create separate connections to the upstream pool for each unique
set of credentials.

## Optional Configuration Options

All configuration options relevant to userproxy mode are listed below. Options
not listed (btcd, btcaddress, redirecturl, nodeserver, trusted, upstream) are
not used in userproxy mode.

**"serverurl"** : Server bindings for miner connections. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Array of strings
- Values: "IP:port" or "hostname:port"
- Default: All interfaces on port 3334
- Note: Ports below 1024 usually require privileged access
- Example: `"serverurl" : ["192.168.1.100:3334", "127.0.0.1:3334"]`

**"mindiff"** : Minimum difficulty for vardiff. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Double
- Values: Any positive number
- Default: 1.0
- Note: Supports sub-"1" values (e.g., 0.0005) for low hash rate miners.
- Example: `"mindiff" : 0.0005`

**"startdiff"** : Starting difficulty for new clients. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Double
- Values: Any positive number
- Default: 42.0
- Note: Can be set below 1 for low hash rate miners.
- Example: `"startdiff" : 0.0005`

**"maxdiff"** : Maximum difficulty for vardiff. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Integer64
- Values: Positive integer, or 0 for no maximum
- Default: 0 (no maximum)

**"update_interval"** : Frequency to send stratum updates. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Integer
- Values: Seconds (positive integer)
- Default: 30

**"nonce2length"** : Length of extranonce2 in bytes. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Integer
- Values: 2-8
- Default: 0 (proxy mode)

**"logdir"** : Directory for logs. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: String
- Default: "logs"

**"maxclients"** : Maximum concurrent client connections. **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Integer
- Default: 0 (no limit)

**"useragent"** : Allowed user agent strings (whitelist). **OPTIONAL**
- Type: Array of strings
- Default: None (all allowed)
- Note: Prefix matching. Empty user agents rejected if whitelist configured.
